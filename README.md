# `ocre-texts`

Work with coin legends from *Online Coins of the Roman Empire*.

The source data for this project is the RDF data set from nomisma.org.  It is too large to add to a github repository, so to use the scripts in this directory:

1. download a copy of the OCRE data set in RDF format from <http://nomisma.org/datasets>, or download this copy downloaded from nomisma.org in Nov., 2017: <http://shot.holycross.edu/ocre-data/ocre-all.rdf>.
2. place the file in the `ocre-data` directory, and rename it `ocre-all.rdf`.
